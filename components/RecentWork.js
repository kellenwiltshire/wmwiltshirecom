						Three very diverse animals are united in a common goal: survival.
						Witness their remarkable journey as they search for a new home, one
						away from humans. These inspiring animals face perilous trials and
						harrowing challenges in a magnificent ecosystem that is rapidly
						disappearing. ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION is a heartwarming story
						about three unique characters: Marty, Chantel, and Bubba. Itâ€™s about
						their amazing journey, the bond they build, and the family they
						become. Humans brought them to the brink of extinction. Is it too
						late now to save them?
